Code to compile: g++ -o main Game.cpp

Compilable Code: 
Game.cpp

Our entire project is inside Game.cpp, and it is a fully compilable code, which is also ready to run. 

Uncompible Code:
After we had our game up and running, we though it might be a good idea to make our code more optimized. Therefore, we decided to take the T.A rematrks from stage 3 into consideration, and tried our attempt to modularize everything.
Our attempt to modularize everything did not result in a succesfully attempt. However, we wanted to bring into consideration that we have tried to improve on our mistakes from last stage.

The following files are not compiable, but tese files were built as an attempt to make already running code modularized:
mygetchar.cpp
mygetchar.h
mazeGenerator.cpp
mazeGenerator.h
levels.cpp
levels.h
mazeArray.cpp
mazeArray.h
display.cpp
display.h
